Let's Get Read is a news-reader application utilizing the New York Times Top Stories API that allows a user to view the top stories from the New York Times website, see further details of a specific story, and filter the different stories by section via a dropdown menu. The overall time goal was to complete the MVP between 6-8 hours. MVP was reached in roughly 5 hours with the last 1-2 hours being spent refactoring, styling, and testing accessibility.
<br />
<br />
This take home assignment was assigned during the fourth and final module of Turing School of Software & Design's Front-End Engineering program. It's main goal was to give students an opportunity to simulate a take home assessment a junior developer may experience during the job hunt. This project includes React, React-Router, and more. The details of this project are outlined in <a href="https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe">this</a> project spec.

### Organization

- [MVP Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JtURyxsNPA-oAYqSkOnX2DYhMUOQ4dgZQpS8F2Ps44/edit?usp=sharing)  
- [Notion Document](https://flower-gravity-d1c.notion.site/Take-Home-Project-85205f19c89a404e8a02f05a59b85087) for general notes, link-grouping, and time-boxing of the project
- [Project Board](https://github.com/users/danalchapman/projects/2/views/1)
- [Figma JamBoard](https://www.figma.com/file/WufaC4yhWY7TSFpjkQ8hQX/Mod-4-%7C%7C-Take-Home-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1&t=g8nKXDf5VV1AynJL-1)

I utilized Figma's Jamboard for the Component Architecture and general Wireframe for the project. Throughout the course of reaching MVP I made minor adjustments to the wireframe, specifically with the `DetailView` component where I made the decision to turn the `NavBar` component into a `form` element on `TopStoriesBox` for ease of user interaction - when a user is on `DetailView` the dropdown menu is no longer visible until they return to the front page.

## Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the repository
- Make sure the necessary dependencies are installed on your local machine (`react-router-dom`, `cypress`)
- Once the necessary dependencies are installed, run `npm start`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add in functionality for a User to save an article to be viewed later
- [ ] Add in a search functionality for a User to search by typing into a search bar
- [x] Cypress Testing
- [ ] Dark Mode

## Features

- This application utilizes the React framework, with React-Router to add in a multi-page user experience and PropTypes to check data types. Error Handling was implemented in order to handle invalid urls and allows a User to either be redirected to the front page, or be shown a friendly, readable message and a button to return to the front page.

### Reflections
<b>Wins:</b><br>
Reaching MVP in around 5 hours was a big win for the overall assessment, being able to utilize the tools and foundational knowledge I've learned during Turing School of Software & Design's Frontend Engineering program and bring a user-friendly and accessible application to life is so fulfilling. When it comes to the code itself, creating and implementing the filter functionality via a dropdown menu that allows a user to see an assortment of top stories from a given topic was a huge win.
<p>
<b>Challenges:</b><br>
Making the decision to pivot from implementing Cypress testing before testing for accessibility was a difficult one, but one I fully believe in and am glad I made the choice. I am so passionate about making the online space accessible, and this project still has more to grow but with a 100% in Chrome's Lighthouse and 0 errors in the WAVE tool, I think I've made significant progress.
