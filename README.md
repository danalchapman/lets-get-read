<br />
This take home assignment was assigned during the fourth and final module of Turing's Front-End Engineering program. It's main goal was to give students an opportunity to simulate an actual take home assessment a junior developer may experience during the job hunt. This project includes React, React-Router, Cypress, and more. The details of this project are outlined in <a href="https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe">this</a> project spec.

## Setup
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the repository
- Make sure the necessary dependencies are installed on your local machine (`react-router-dom`, `cypress`)
- Once the necessary dependencies are installed, `cd` back into the root of the repository, and run `npm start`

## Roadmap

- [ ] Refactor application for syntax and styling consistency
- [ ] Add in functionality for a User to save an article to be viewed later
- [ ] Add in a search functionality for a User to search by typing into a search bar

## Features

- This application utilizes the React framework, with React-Router to add in a multi-page user experience and PropTypes to check data types. Error Handling was implemented in order to handle invalid urls and allows a User to either be redirected to the front page, or be shown a friendly, readable message and a button to return to the front page.

### Reflections
<b>Wins:</b><br>
Reaching MVP in around 5 hours was a big win for the overall assessment, being able to utilize the tools and foundational knowledge I've learned during Turing School of Software & Design's Frontend Engineering program and bring a user-friendly and accessible application to life is so fulfilling. When it comes to the code itself, creating and implementing the filter functionality via a dropdown menu that allows a user to see an assortment of top stories from a given topic was a huge win.
<p>
<b>Challenges:</b><br>
Making the decision to pivot from implementing Cypress testing before testing for accessibility was a difficult one, but one I fully believe in and am glad I made the choice. I am so passionate about making the online space accessible, and this project still has more to grow but with a 100% in Chrome's Lighthouse and 0 errors in the WAVE tool, I think I've made significant progress.
